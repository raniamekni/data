      <p class="SQLite">
                SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. The lite in SQLite means lightweight in terms of setup, database administration, and required resources.

SQLite has the following noticeable features: self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional.

Serverless
Normally, an RDBMS such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc., requires a separate server process to operate. The applications that want to access the database server use TCP/IP protocol to send and receive requests. This is called client/server architecture.

      <p class="postgres">
        PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

There is a wealth of information to be found describing how to install and use PostgreSQL through the official documentation. The PostgreSQL community provides many helpful places to become familiar with the technology, discover how it works, and find career opportunities. Reach out to the community here.

     <p class="mysql"> 
     MySQL is a relational database management system based on SQL â€“ Structured Query Language. The application is used for a wide range of purposes, including data warehousing, e-commerce, and logging applications.

The most common use for mySQL however, is for the purpose of a web database. It can be used to store anything from a single record of information to an entire inventory of available products for an online store.

In association with a scripting language such as PHP or Perl (both offered on our hosting accounts) it is possible to create websites which will interact in real-time with a mySQL database to rapidly display categorised and searchable information to a website user
